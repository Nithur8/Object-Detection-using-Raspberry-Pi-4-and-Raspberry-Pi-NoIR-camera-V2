# Object-Detection-using-Raspberry-Pi-4-and-Raspberry-Pi-NoIR-camera-V2
## Raspberry Pi Fundamentals (Prerequisites)

Before implementing object detection using the **Raspberry Pi 4** and **NoIR Camera V2**, the following Raspberry Pi concepts and techniques were practiced:

* Setting up and operating **Raspberry Pi OS in headless mode**
* Accessing and controlling the Raspberry Pi remotely using **SSH**
* Managing Wi-Fi connections and network configuration via terminal
* Working with the **libcamera** stack and **rpicam-apps**
* Capturing images using **rpicam-still** and verifying camera functionality
* Transferring files between local PC and Raspberry Pi using **SCP**
* Understanding the build and usage of **rpicam-detect (TensorFlow Lite)**

These fundamentals form the base for implementing and experimenting with real-time object detection on Raspberry Pi.
