## Documentation References

The following official documentation and guides were referred to while learning and working with Raspberry Pi fundamentals:

* **Getting Started**

  * Raspberry Pi OS installation and initial setup
    [https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html)

* **Remote Access**

  * Accessing Raspberry Pi headlessly using SSH
    [https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/remote-access.html)

* **Network Configuration**

  * Managing Wi-Fi connections and network settings
    [https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html)

These resources were used to understand system setup, remote operation, and network management before implementing object detection.

## Raspberry Pi Fundamentals (Prerequisites)

Before implementing object detection using the **Raspberry Pi 4** and **NoIR Camera V2**, the following Raspberry Pi concepts and techniques were practiced:

* Setting up and operating **Raspberry Pi OS in headless mode**
* Accessing and controlling the Raspberry Pi remotely using **SSH**
* Managing Wi-Fi connections and network configuration via terminal
* Working with the **libcamera** stack and **rpicam-apps**
* Capturing images using **rpicam-still** and verifying camera functionality
* Understanding the build and usage of **rpicam-detect (TensorFlow Lite)**

These fundamentals form the base for implementing and experimenting with real-time object detection on Raspberry Pi.

## Process 
1. Update the system packages: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y`
2. Create a folder:- YOLO_Detect
3.
